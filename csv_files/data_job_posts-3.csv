"Media Diversity Institute (MDI)
TITLE:  Team Reporting Project
EVENT TYPE:  Topic development
OPEN TO/ ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:  Broadcast journalists working in Georgia
and Armenia.
START DATE/ TIME:  10 May 2005
DURATION:  10 days
LOCATION:  Yerevan, Armenia
DETAIL DESCRIPTION:  Media Diversity Institute (MDI) will hold a Team
Reporting Project for broadcast journalists working in Georgia and
Armenia. A team reporting project is a 10 day project designed to bring
cross-ethnic groups of journalists together to work on one topic
extensively during the 10 days. The topic for the project is decided by
the entire team together. The topic will certainly be related to
diversity topics such as ethnic minorities, religious minorities,
disabled people, refugees or IDPs - basically any group that is
generally marginalised by the mainstream media. The journalists produce
TV pieces together in teams and then all pieces are edited and put into
a 30 minute programme which is made available to any TV station free of
charge. A copy will be available to all participants as well. There will
be a local language version of each programme produced. This will be
achieved by proving subtitles or dubbing where necessary.
There will be one team that is made up of 8 TV journalists and two
trainers. 4 journalists will be from Armenia and 4 from Georgia. 
There will be one international and one local trainer working throughout
the project. The project will be held primarily in Russian. 
But pieces will be written in your native language and translated into
the English for editing. They will then be translated into Armenian and
Georgian for the local language production of each programme.
Project format:
The project takes 10 days. It will be primarily based on one country. In
this case the base is Yerevan. Journalists will travel throughout the
country or region that the project is taking place in - wherever the
story takes them. All travel and accommodation throughout the 10 days
will be covered by MDI. MDI will also provide travel to Yerevan where
needed to take part in the course. MDI will also provide a per diem of
$15 for each of the 10 days of the project. Knowledge of English
language isn't necessary (translation will be provided in both
languages), but Basic understanding of Russian is essential.
APPLICATION PROCEDURES:  MDI is currently recruiting participants for
this event. If you are a journalist working in the broadcast media in
Georgia or Armenia and are interested in developing your skills in
diversity reporting, together with your investigative skills, please

ABOUT COMPANY:  CARD is an impact-based organization originating from
the United States Department of Agricultures 12-year Marketing
Assistance Project providing economic development solutions in the
Caucasus. CARD is dedicated to reducing rural poverty and increasing the
standard of living of its clients by offering a comprehensive, integrated
package of market- and farmer-driven services, including marketing, rural
development, and credit.
ABOUT:  Water for irrigation is critical to Armenia for the production
of food crops essential for internal and potential export markets. Since
land privatization after the collapse of the Soviet Union, many new
owners of small farms are inexperienced in production agriculture, and
the existing irrigation infrastructure does not address the needs of
small plots. Currently deployed cropping and irrigation practices do not
make the best use of water resources.  In general, there is a lack of
knowledge regarding fundamental soil, water, and plant relationships;
moreover, Extension personnel at all levels are unfamiliar with modern
irrigation agricultural practices and are in need of training in
irrigation and soil water fundamentals, furrow irrigation management,
and in the use of related equipment. There are many opportunities in
Armenia for demonstrating crop, soil, and water management fundamentals,
improved cultural practices, and efficient and economical irrigation
management.
